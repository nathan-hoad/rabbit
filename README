rabbit

Dependencies:
-------------
Python 2.6, at least
python-pysqlite, any recent version. (I used 2.6.0-1) 

General:
--------
Ahh, the apple of my eye. Rabbit is an issue-tracker created for 
lone-wolf developer projects (as most of mine are).

I noticed that all of my small projects had no simple, standard way to keep 
track of bugs, features, ideas and notes in general about them and so quite 
often, no documentation of these sorts was ever done and the projects would 
become awful messes.

And so, I set out on a quest to find some simple, single user issue tracker 
software. But alas, I found none. Every single solution was undoubtedly a 
web-based behemoth which I was not going to do for a 200 line python script.

With that, I decided I could write my own easily enough. And here, we have rabbit.

Installation:
-------------

Copy to a bin folder of your choice. Personally, I make a symbolic link from ~/bin/
chmod +x it like normal. And there you go!

Configuration:
--------------

There is very little to configure about this, in fact I don't think there is 
any. Simply use it!


Usage:
------
Usage of this glorious software is a bit difficult at first, but it gets 
easier the more you use it (hint hint!).

To add an issue:
   rabbit add -b "Example brief description" -d "example long description" -t enhancement

To remove an issue:
   rabbit rm 1

Displaying issues:
   rabbit list

Displaying a specific issue in detailed form:
   rabbit detail 1

And so on. To get a full list of the available options to you, run this:
   rabbit help

Suggestions:
------------

As I develop this software by myself, I also maintain the bugs and enhancements
myself, with rabbit no less! So if you have any suggestions, or find a bug,
please contact me via my details in the AUTHORS file.
